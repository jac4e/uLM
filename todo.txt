General:
    - Create calibration procedure
    - Test and measure devices characteristics
    - Create sample software in multiple languages
    - Flesh out documentation

REV 1.1:
    Goals:
	    - Reduce cost
	    - Improve board design

    Hardware changes:
        OpAmp: 
            - LMC6041
	        - $3.02 instead of $11.79
            - Same footprint and pin layout as LTC6268
	        - Slightly under spec, but is still sufficient
        Connector:
            - Basic header pins
	        - Generally better than Molex Connector
        ADC:
            - ADS1100
            - ~$3 instead of ~$7
            - Same footprint, pin layout, and interface
            - Lower resolution

    Board Changes:
        - Replace SMD feedback resistor with throughholes for axial resistor
            - Allows for easy replacement of resistor
